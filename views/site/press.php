    <p>ILLIDIANCE - Russia&#39;s best-known Modern Metal / Cyber Metal act that rocks out catchy, original, and
        technical alternative metal of the millennium - was formed back in 2005. From the beginning ILLIDIANCE was
        acting as melodic death/black metal band but from 2009 moved to modern/cyber metal niche. The raw power and the
